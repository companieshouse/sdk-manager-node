# sdk-manager-node
Library to manage interactions with APIs by initialising an SDK with an authenticated HTTP Client

Note that this is a 'public' repository and not 'private' like the other SDK managers. This is deliberate, since it satisfies the criteria for 'public' repos, stated here - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed.
